## Statement

I decide to share the code of my first paper titled [***'Optimizing Reservoir Computing Based on an Alternating Input-Driven Spin-Torque Oscillator.'***](https://journals.aps.org/prapplied/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevApplied.20.024069) The code includes dynamic simulations of a magnetic tunnel junction driven by various current configurations, a spin-torque oscillator-based reservoir computing framework, Lyapunov exponent calculations, quantification of the echo-state property, and estimation of the information processing capacity. I hope this 'useless' code can contribute to the development of the scientific community, especially for the in-memory computing with MRAM and physical reservoir computing. I welcome any feedback or questions regarding my project. Please feel free to contact me via email.
