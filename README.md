<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

There are many dynamical regions in magnetic tunnel junction, and we also call them as stable switching MTJ, oscillator MTJ and chaotic MTJ following their diversified linear or nonlinear performances. Physical reservoir computing is a novelty field attracting more and more researchers, especially for prediction of chaotic function and hardware acceleration.

Here's branches of our project:
* Stable switching MTJ
* Oscillator MTJ
* Weaker-Chaotic MTJ

Of course, we apply these different system running on _**parity check task**, **classification task** and **delay task**_. 

See the `README.md` to get more details.
