<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Information

There are many dynamical regions in magnetic tunnel junction, and we also call them as stable switching MTJ, oscillator MTJ and chaotic MTJ following their diversified linear or nonlinear performances. Physical reservoir computing is a novelty field attracting more and more researchers, especially for prediction of chaotic function and hardware acceleration.

Here's branches of our project:
* `Stable switching MTJ`
* `Oscillator MTJ`
* `Weaker-Chaotic MTJ`

Of course, we apply these different system running on _**parity check task**, **NARMA task** and **delay task**_. Here, we utilized the spin-torque osillator to build a reservoir computing system.

## Abstract
The neurons in the brains show nonlinear oscillator-like behaviors, inspiring the development of neuromorphic computing with spin-torque oscillators for their low power consumption and high integration density. The time-multiplexing technique enables utilizing only one device to achieve neuromorphic computing, further reducing power consumption and simplifying device fabrication. However, optimizing such systems remains a challenge and needs further development. A controversial hypothesis claims that dynamic systems possess the optimal computational capacity to address the information at the dynamical phase transition. Here, we utilize this hypothesis to improve a reservoir computing system built by a single spin-torque oscillator. The input-driven property of reservoir computing allows us to exploit the dynamics of a spin-torque oscillator by manipulating the input stream. By tuning the AC component in inputs without any stochastic signal, the system can exhibit diversified dynamic regimes indicated by the largest Lyapunov exponent and echo state property spectra. Our findings demonstrate that the proper configuration of AC inputs for reservoir
computing based on a single spin-torque oscillator can adjust its information processing capacity profile and enhance its computational performance for specific tasks.
